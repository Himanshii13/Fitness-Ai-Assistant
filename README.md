# 🧩 Problem Statement
In today’s fast-paced world, many individuals struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle due to lack of personalized guidance, time constraints, and inconsistent motivation. Traditional fitness solutions often require expensive subscriptions, in-person consultations, or rigid schedules that don’t adapt to personal preferences or daily routines.

There is a growing need for an accessible, friendly, and intelligent virtual assistant that can provide on-demand fitness advice, healthy lifestyle suggestions, and basic nutrition guidance—all tailored to individual needs and available at any time.

# 💡 Proposed Solution
Fitness Buddy is an AI-powered health and fitness assistant built using IBM Watsonx.ai. It acts as a conversational coach that recommends personalized workout routines, provides motivational tips, and suggests simple, nutritious meal ideas. With the help of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it delivers evidence-based fitness and nutrition guidance grounded in verified documents and research.
